# 100DaysofCode [python-mastery]

 This repository contains my day-by-day progress, organized by difficulty level.



## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main directories based on the difficulty level:

- **Beginner**: Contains folders named `dayXX` (e.g., `day1`, `day2`, etc.)
- **Intermediate**: Contains folders named `DayXX` (e.g., `Day1`, `Day2`, etc.)
- **Advanced**: Contains folders named `DAYXX` (e.g., `DAY1`, `DAY2`, etc.)

Each folder contains the work completed on that particular day, including any codes, notes, images and project files.
